                    Lauded by acclaimed trumpeter Allan Dean as &quot;wonderful people and excellent players&quot;, Amo Brass is an emerging 
                    chamber music ensemble which blends musical entertainment with artistic excellence. Composed of Yale School of 
                    Music alumni, the ensemble is based in the Triâ€“State area and is passionate about education, outreach, and 
                    performance. In 2023, Amo Brass was a Finalist Prize-winner at the Plowman Chamber Music Competition, and 
                    received the ABQ Prize at the 50th Fischoff Competition. The ensemble has completed residencies at Avaloch 
                    Farms Music Institute and Norfolk Chamber Music Festival. In April, they embarked on a week-long educational 
                    outreach tour for public school students in the California Bay Area to advance their mission of musical 
                    experience which offers a commitment to accessible education, cultural leadership, and service to society 
                    through the arts. Amo Brass frequently works with local organizations and non-profits, and firmly believes 
                    in balancing world class artistry with community partnership.
